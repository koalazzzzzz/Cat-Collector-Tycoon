# Cat-Collector-Tycoon
Tycoon Game
Title: Cat Collector Tycoon

Description and End Product:
Collect cats and expand your cat collection. 
You are given a living area, and everyday cats wander around your area and come to your living area. 
You start the game with a reasonable amount of currency to buy food and toys to get started with. 
Each cat you collect gives you a certain amount of currency depending on the cats traits (color, fur type, size). 
Cat traits will be randomized so that most cats you collect are unique. 
Youâ€™re able to use your currency to buy cat food and toys. 
Food you buy disappears everyday so you need to be wise on your decisions. 
Toys last longer than one day but still expire over a certain amount of days. 
Food is NEEDED for keeping the cats you collect. 
Toys are NEEDED for attracting outside cats to come to you and there can be certain toys that attract cats that have more ideal traits. 
Cats you collect are able to wander away from you if they are not satisfied with your care for them. 
Wandering off is caused by having no money, 
and not feeding them enough food so you need to keep a balance of buying food and toys as buying food constantly drains you. 
The more cats that wander off, the higher chance of other cats wandering off as well. 
Cats with better traits (Rare Cats)
take in more expensive toys and gives you much more money than a regular cat with the trade off of requiring more food per day. 
When rare cats wander off, they take other cats to wander off with them so that it gives you the objective of maintaining your rare cats.
Every now and then, there will be a famine, where the store you buy the food from will have lower stock and cost more to buy. 
This concept lets you choose if you want to use more your food on rare cats or distribute it evenly among less rare cats.

YOU LOSE when all cats wander off from you OR if you run out of money to buy any more toys or food.

Applying Skills:
I will have a combination of many different skills we learned in class incorporated into my game such as loops, type trapping, if statements,etc.
